# I'll do the hard work, you'll get the rewards. 

Hey there, I’m Nick. 

I’m a direct response copywriter, I use my words to make you money. I’m talking doubling, tripling, QUADRUPLING your profit, just with some words and a bit of flair (and a bit of copywriting magic you won’t learn in school). I will tell you more about unlocking hidden profits in your products soon. But first, I will share the purpose of this blog.

I am deeply fascinated by learning new things. But that comes at a price, I can only remember so much at once. If I don’t write it down, it will soon fizzle away to the furthest part of my brain until I revisit that subject. 

And that’s a problem. It’s knowledge that you’d benefit from, so instead of keeping you in the dark, I’m going to share it! I do the dirty work of going through articles, videos, seminars, lectures, research journals, scientific papers, and so on... I must be crazy if I do this for fun. But you reap the benefits. What’s in it for me?

That's the real question - **Why would I do this?**

I benefit from it too. It means I have to take all of my notes, and then boil it down to fit in a blog post. It’s a lot easier to go through notes the size of a blog post instead of a small book. It saves me time, and I don’t have to work as hard in the long run. 

The main subject matter of this blog will be copywriting and technology. It’s what I focus my work on, too. That doesn’t mean I won’t share other subjects! It just means that the focus is on copywriting and technology. 

Nick
